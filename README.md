When creating an issue, please include lots and lots of detail. Videos are preferred, screenshots and full console logs at the very minimum. The following will also be nessecary:
- AAC version
- ProtocolLib version
- Full plugin list
- Explanation of how to reproduce the issue.

If your explanation is too vague, or the issue can't be reproduced, then your issue will be closed.

The AAC Test Server is currently public and is at **aac3.kons.co**

A public discord server is available at **https://discord.gg/uc9w2nx**

### Those who join the test server purely to develop bypasses, without any obvious intention of helping AAC develop, will be removed from the server.

## Notice board
- Check #494 if your server crashes and the error contains the phrase "getCubes"
